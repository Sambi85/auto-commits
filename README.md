"OH DEAR!!! ðŸ¦Œ "

Dear Reader,

Looks like you stumbled onto my super cool github actions test. Please understand I created this repo to explore the use cases of github actions. Automation is an interest of mine, and I like to explore this further. This isn't designed to dupe, hoodwink, or bamboozle any one. Just testing git commits.

Thanks for understanding,

- Sam 



Notes:
- If you like what've done, make sure you setup your Github secrets & PAT(personal access token) 
- You'll need to know a some Shell commands + syntax, I used Bash for this mini project.
- Don't be frightened, it's an easy and fun way to explore Github actions!!!
