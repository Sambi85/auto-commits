Dear Reader,

Looks like you stumbled onto my super cool github actions test. Please understand I created this repo to explore the use cases of github actions. Automation is an interest of mine, and I like to explore this further. This isn't designed to dupe, hoodwink, or bamboozle any companies, interested coders and recruiters.

Thanks for understanding,

- Sam
