Dear Reader,

Looks like you stumbled onto my super cool github actions test. Please understand I created this repo to explore the use cases of github actions. Automation is an interest of mine, and I like to explore this further. This isn't designed to dupe, hoodwink, or bamboozle any one. Just testing git commits.

Thanks for understanding,

- Sam 



Notes:
It's worth looking into Bash as well. You'll need to know a few things before you can setup and deploy. Why not make this a great opportunity to learn some syntax? Checkout the links below!!!
